ML Definition by Tom Mitchell - "A computer program is said to learn from Experience E w.r.t. some class of Tasks T and Performance measure P, if its performance at Tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with Experience E"

Example: Simulating Big Bang

E = Experience gained from past simulations of Big Bang

T = Task to simulate Big Bang

P = Probability measure of a successfull simulation
