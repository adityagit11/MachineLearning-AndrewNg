# ML Definition:

ML Definition by Tom Mitchell - "A computer program is said to learn from Experience E w.r.t. some class of Tasks T and Performance measure P, if its performance at Tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with Experience E"

Example: Simulating Big Bang

E = Experience gained from past simulations of Big Bang

T = Task to simulate Big Bang

P = Probability measure of a successfull simulation

# Supervised Learning:

In supervised learning we have the data set and we know the relationship between input and output.

```Regression Problem```: Suppose you have a dataset of student's math mark in class 12th and same student's mark in Subject Math - 4th Semester of his B.E. Such that now you have to find given a new student's math mark in class 12th what will be its marks in Subject Math - 4th Semester.

So basically by the use of regression we are trying to predict a continous value output. Meaning we are trying to map input variables to some continous function.

```Classification Problem```: Suppose you have a dataset of student's math mark in class 12th and whether or not that student went to PHD in math. So now if a new student's math mark is entered then we have to predict whether the student will go for PHD in math.

Now this basically gives a discrete value (0 or 1) output. Hence this is classfication problem. But classfication problem can not limit itself to 2 outputs ony (0 or 1), there could be multiple outputs as well.
